# Tutorials World

This is a simple project (Tutorials World) for the reference for any help in development, and that can/will be community managed.

As the name of the project, the concept here used is:

* You can find any language or any tool in the homepage.
* You can find solutions for any language/tool posted by any other person or by yourself previously.
* You can search by keyword from the Problem or solution or both.
* Then Click on Toggle Solution.
* The page shows the problem, solution, date of added, and name of the person added.
* You can add new Solution of any problem you faced for future references and can help others as well if they face similar problem.
* You can check your Solutions posted and even can edit them.
* You can contact me directly by the link Contact, you can request to add new language, or any addition you need problem you face in the site.
* You need to be logged in to post solution.
* Login doesn't require any verification or anything, that's just for the name who posted and manage your posted content.
